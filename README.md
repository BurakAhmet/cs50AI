- ### Knowledge
  - [Knights](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/cs50AI/tree/main/1.Knowledge/knights): A program that solves the "Knights and Knaves" puzzles using logical statements.
    
  - [Minesweeper](https://github.com/BurakAhmet/cs50AI/tree/main/1.Knowledge/minesweeper): Minesweeper game with helps of artificial intelligence. When clicks on AI move, AI calculates the best move and plays it. If there is no computable move then AI makes a random move.
