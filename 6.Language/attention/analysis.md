# Analysis

## Layer 2, Head 5

It seems to be capturing some information between possessive pronouns and the words they modify. While looking at the output, I found that this head intently focuses on how these possessive pronouns such as "his," or, her", and their" connect with the respective nouns right after.

Example Sentences:
- [MASK]] book was on the table.
- [MASK]] house is at the corner.

## Layer 6, Head 3

This one head seems to model the connection between conjunctions and a pair of connected clauses. For many sentences, the head is probably going to be interested in conjunctions like "and", "but", "or", "because" since this shows an interest for its following phrase.

Example Sentences:
- She went to store [MASK] he stayed home.
- I didn't come to the party [MASK] I was tired.
